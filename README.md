# Linux + Thinkpad speaker improvements

Thinkpads ship by default with Windows, which comes with Dolby Atmos software that improves the sound quality coming from the speakers significantly. This is very noticeable if you turn the Dolby effects on and off while playing music. This software is not available under Linux, which means the sound quality is roughly the same as what you hear with the Dolby effects turned off. The resulting quality can be pretty bad. For example, at high volumes, I can hear significant chassis resonance for certain laptop models while playing music.
